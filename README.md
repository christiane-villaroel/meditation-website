# meditation-website

- The goals of this website is to inform users of the benefits of practicing mindfulness and meditation
- Provide free guided mediation and resources to aid in meditation practice

## Developer Skills:
- The overall purpose for creating this website is to practice using Bootstrap 4.5, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- I also had some minor exposure in using JQuery in order to make minor changes to the Bootsraps button class color.


### Project Status:

As of now this project only has one page simply, as I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp and am trying to build other projects as I move along each course.
Eventually I do plan on adding more pages to this project in the near feature.
